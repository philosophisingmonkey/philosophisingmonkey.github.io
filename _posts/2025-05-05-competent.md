For most of my life, I was either goofy or a bit dopey. I let things slide, thinking, _“As long as the major parts are okay, it’s fine.”_ I lacked focus and concentration, often scrambling at the last minute just to get by. I operated in a hazy, unfocused mode, drifting through tasks without real intention or sharpness.

**That phase of my life is over.**

I want to become the best in the world at what I do. This new phase is all about becoming a high-functioning, razor-sharp individual. I want to be someone who commands respect-not through undeniable skill and professionalism.

You have to be capable to earn true respect. When you’re competent, people trust you, rely on you, and value your contributions. That’s why I believe everyone should push themselves to become really, really good at something.

- **Become sharp.** Sharpen your skills, your focus, your mindset.
- **Become a perfectionist.** Set high standards not to stress over mistakes, but to handle any situation with confidence and grace.
- **Be a professional.** Show up, deliver, and maintain your cool no matter what.
- **Become the person everyone depends on.** Stop doubting yourself. Cultivate a calm, zen-like confidence.
- **No more complaining or wingeing.** Take ownership of your life and your growth.
    
I’m pushing my mind to the max too-aiming to perform feats others think impossible. The key is to lock in, stay focused, and never let distractions or setbacks knock me off course. If I fall, I’ll get right back up.

**F••• victim mentality**

"
_Some people are victimised by other people. And if it weren't for the indignation that that causes we wouldn't have reforms that we need. But that truth is mixed with another. It’s very counterproductive for an individual to feel like a victim even if he is. Best attitude is just to be cheerful about everything and keep plugging along_.
"
- Charline Munger

“_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom_” 
- Viktor Frankl

"_My formula for greatness is [**amor fati:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati) That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backwards, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it….but love it._”

- Nietzsche

Never, ever, ever have victim mentality. There is always someone who has it worse than you.


Here’s my blueprint for success:
- **Build unbreakable consistency.** Show up and deliver, **even when motivation is low.**
- **Train mind and body relentlessly.** Make exercise, learning, and discipline daily habits.
- **Embrace setbacks.** Fail, get back up, repeat.
- **Love the grind.** Enjoy the journey, not just the results.
- **Manage stress and optimise your environment.** Set clear goals and boundaries to avoid burnout.
    
**My Challenge to myself**

Our bodies and minds are capable of so much more than we give them credit for. I’m committed to reaching the top 1%-and nothing will stop me. Let’s become the sharpest, most competent versions of ourselves. No more jokers. No more excuses. Just relentless growth.

**Let’s get to work.**
