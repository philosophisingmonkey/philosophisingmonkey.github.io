No one likes haters. We try our best to remove the existence of haters or negative people in our lives as much as possible, but somehow these people find a way in. How should you handle these haters? Haters need attention and they want to control other people because they lack a control of their own lives. Remember you cannot fix them. You can only control your response to them. Here are some strategies we can use to respond to haters:
-  Is what they said true?
    - If yes, why be upset. They have stated the truth.
    - If no, inform them of the truth.
- Do you even respect the person?
    - If yes, thank them for informing you and use it to improve.
    - If no, be relieved, you must be doing something right.
- Use humour. Humour can dispense tension in many situations.
- Accept it, ignore it and outwork them
	- If you aren’t ashamed of something, you won’t care if people tease you about it. The shame comes from a misguided sense that you’re supposed to be perfect.
