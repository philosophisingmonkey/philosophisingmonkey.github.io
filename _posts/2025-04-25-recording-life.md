I have iterated multiple times on how I record my life and I expect I will iterate many 
more times but this routine has been working quite well for me recently.

I use the Day One app to record my life notes. I find it super helpful as it 
forces me to be self aware of my time. I can tell when my journal is pretty 
empty that I am being useless and I need fix up and do something meaningful.


In my **Daily journal** note I write about the main goals for the day and note key events that occurred that day. Day One has a nice calendar view feature which lets you see the pictures as little icons over time. I try to upload a picture of something that happened that day every day. At the moment of writing I am on an 87 day streak.

At the start of the week, I write my weekly goals in my **Weekly journal** 
where I bullet point my goals for the week both personal and work goals. At the end of the week, I start a new note where I write a summary of my learnings that week: Learnings from the week, my wins and things to work on. I find it useful to re-read the daily journal for the week.

I do yearly reviews where I list out key experiences, accomplishments, life lessons and things to work on for next year. I have been doing yearly reviews since 2019.

I find that recording my life like this allows me to error correct on a frequent basis and keeps me super productive.
