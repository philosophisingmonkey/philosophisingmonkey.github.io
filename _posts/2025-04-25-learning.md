1. Read through the contents page
2. Create a **visual image** that ties the concepts together in a way. When you learn something new link it back to the bigger picture. Close your eyes and picture the thing you are thinking of. Really imagine what is happening. Allow the information to really rest and take form in your brain. 
3. Think of lots of questions to attack the topic from multiple angles:
	- Can you teach the image you made?
	- What evidence do i have for the image?
	- What do i exactly think of this?
	- What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if i am?
	- What might others think? How do I know i am correct?
	- Can I compare sources against each other?
	- How can I apply this image in a useful way? 
	- Can you write the image as words?
	- Apply What, When, Why, Where, How in different ways?
4. Create questions about what you just learnt
5. Rest. Move your body
6. Start next learning session. Answer your questions then repeat steps 2-5

**Optional tips:**
- Try teaching the content to others to improve understanding
- Learn the same content using different sources such as text books and videos
- Practice applying the new content
