For most of my life, I was either goofy or a bit dopey. I let things slide, thinking, _“As long as the major parts are okay, it’s fine.”_ I lacked focus and concentration, often scrambling at the last minute just to get by. I operated in a hazy, unfocused mode, drifting through tasks without real intention or sharpness.

**That phase of my life is over.**

I want to become the best in the world at what I do. This new phase is all about becoming a high-functioning, razor-sharp individual. I want to be someone who commands respect-not through undeniable skill and professionalism.

You have to be capable to earn true respect. When you’re competent, people trust you, rely on you, and value your contributions. That’s why I believe everyone should push themselves to become really, really good at something.

- **Become sharp.** Sharpen your skills, your focus, your mindset.
- **Become a perfectionist.** Set high standards not to stress over mistakes, but to handle any situation with confidence and grace.
- **Be a professional.** Show up, deliver, and maintain your cool no matter what.
- **Become the person everyone depends on.** Stop doubting yourself. Cultivate a calm, zen-like confidence.
- **No more complaining or wingeing.** Take ownership of your life and your growth.
    
I’m pushing my mind to the max too-aiming to perform feats others think impossible. The key is to lock in, stay focused, and never let distractions or setbacks knock me off course. If I fall, I’ll get right back up.

Here’s my blueprint for success:
- **Build unbreakable consistency.** Show up and deliver, **even when motivation is low.**
- **Train mind and body relentlessly.** Make exercise, learning, and discipline daily habits.
- **Embrace setbacks.** Fail, get back up, repeat.
- **Love the grind.** Enjoy the journey, not just the results.
- **Manage stress and optimise your environment.** Set clear goals and boundaries to avoid burnout.
    
**My Challenge to myself**

Our bodies and minds are capable of so much more than we give them credit for. I’m committed to reaching the top 1%-and nothing will stop me. Let’s become the sharpest, most competent versions of ourselves. No more jokers. No more excuses. Just relentless growth.

**Let’s get to work.**
