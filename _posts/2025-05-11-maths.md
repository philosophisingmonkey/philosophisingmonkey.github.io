The major areas of mathematics are:
- **Arithmetic**: The study of numbers and basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Algebra**: The study of symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols to solve equations and understand relationships.
- **Geometry**: The study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space.
- **Calculus**: The study of continuous change, involving derivatives and integrals.
- **Probability and Statistics**: The study of chance, randomness, and data analysis.
- **Trigonometry**: The study of angles
