Back in school I was always quite lost when we were being taught parts of history. In the UK, all i was taught about was the Tudors and World war 2. That's it. I understand that we didn't have much time to be taught the entire history of earth and that history is about analysis of history not just the facts. But it would have been really helpful to have a timeline of how things went down from start to finish. Anyways, this is my attempt at filling that gap.

**The Big bang to Earth**<br>
What better place to start than the very start of it all. 13.8 billion years ago all the matter was concentrated in a single very dense point. Then an explosion caused all the matter to expand rapidly from this single point (and it's still expanding!). We call this event The Big Bang. As matter passed through the universe, enough matter colliding together and coalesced to form stars to be formed. Young stars use hydrogen and helium and release energy using nuclear fusion and is held together by it's own gravity. Our Sun is a start that formed about 9 billion years ago and is situated in a galaxy called the Milky Way. To give a sense of a size of the universe - the Milky way is one of 400 billion galaxies in the observable universe.

**Formation of the Earth**
- 4.6 billion years ago dust surrounded the Sun and formed the Earth.  
- 4.5 billion years ago a mars sized body collides with the Earth, resulting in debris that eventually coalesced to form the Moon.
- 4.0 billion years ago the Earth started out as a molten mass constantly being collied with space matter from the solar system. The Earth cooled and formed a thin crust around it. Water vapour in the air condensed forming the Earth's oceans. 
- 3.8 billion years ago, first life formed on earth, microorganisms likely formed in areas such as hydrothermal vents or hot springs.
- 252 million years ago, a mass extinction event occurred. This is still the most severe loss on life in the history of Earth.
- 230 million years ago, Dinosaurs and Mammals emerge.
- 200 million years ago, the super continent Pangea started breaking up.
- 66 million years ago, a mass extinction likely caused by a large asteroid impact. The Earth's continents stops breaking up and the continents we know of today are formed.
- 7 million years ago, the first hominins emerge, this is where hominins diverged from apes. The physical traits that make us distinct are we started walking on 2 legs and have small canine teeth.
- About 2 million years ago, the ice ages begin.
- About 300,000 years ago, the first homo sapiens emerge from Africa! (that's us!) 
- 100,000 years ago, Homo sapiens begin to migrate out of Africa. Hunter gathers operated, Humans started using fire, forming shelters and hunting with weapons.40,000 years ago, humans started forming advanced tools.
- Approximately 10,000 years ago, human civilisation starts and ice ages end!

**Human civilisation**<br>
As humans transition from hunter gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities around 10,000 years ago. Ancient civilisations form such as:
- Mesopotamia
- Indus Valley
- Ancient Egypt 
- Ancient China
- Ancient Greece: 
- Ancient Rome
- Ancient Peru

**Notable empires through human civilisation include:**
1. **Egyptian Kingdom**  
   Period: 3150–332 BCE
2. **Persian Empire**  
   Period: 550–330 BCE  
3. **Han Dynasty**  
   Period: 202 BCE–220 CE  
4. **Roman Empire**  
   Period: 27 BCE–476 CE
5. **Mayan Empire**  
   Period: 250–900 CE  
6. **Mongol Empire**  
   Period: 1206–1368 CE  
   *Founded by Genghis Khan, largest contiguous land empire*
7. **Ottoman Empire**  
   Period: 1299–1922 CE  
   *Conquered Constantinople in 1453, dissolved after World War I*
8. **Mughal Empire**  
   Period: 1526–1857 CE  
   *Established by Babur, golden age under Akbar*
9. **British Empire**  
   Period: 18th–20th century CE  
   *Largest empire by territory, declined after World War II*

**The main sections of human civilisations can be split into:**
- **Early Bronze Age**: 3300 - 2100 BCE
- **Bronze Age**: 3300 - 1200 BCE
- **Iron Age**: 1200 - 600 BCE
- **Classical Antiquity**: 800 BCE - 476 CE
- **Middle Ages**: 476 - 1453 CE
- **Modern Period**: 1453 CE - Present

Here is a timeline of world history:

**Modern Period**<br>
We will now look at the modern period since it's most recent. During this period, the scientific revolution and industrial Revolution occurred. The transition from an agrarian to an industrial society, was driven by technological innovations such as the steam eninge and the harnessing of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. European imperialism occurred and became the global powers from 1800-1945. Then globalisation and information age ran from 1945 to present day where there is more interconnectedness of the world through technology and trade.

Some key notable events in the modern era are:
- In 1880, Thomas Edison invents the incandescent light bulb.
- In 1903, the Wright brothers achieve the first powered flight.
- In 1913, Niels Bohr proposes a model of the atom with discrete energy levels, laying the groundwork for quantum mechanics.
- In 1945, Atomic bombs are dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
- In 1947, Invention of the transistor by Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain.
- In 1969, Apollo 11 land on the moon
- In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web.
- In 2022, Chatgpt was released by OpenAI


## Looking to the future
Looking ahead into the future, in about 5 billion years from now, the Sun will will run out of hydrogen and start using helium as fuel for nuclear fusion. The Sun will expand to become a red giant where Mercury and Venus be consumed. Earth may survive but will become uninhabitable due to extreme heat. Mars may survive the Sun's expansion. Making Mars habitable might be a good idea at some point...
